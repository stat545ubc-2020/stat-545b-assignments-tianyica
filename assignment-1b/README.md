# STAT 545B Assignment-1b

This is the repository for Assignment-1b in [__STAT 545B__](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/) @ UBC.

This assignment first covers making a function , then using list columns to explore a data set.

This repository consists of an assignment-1B.Rmd file which holds the reproducible code that can be downloaded or copied, and an assignment-1B.md file that displays the outputs.

The function in Assignment-1b has been wrapped into the [__scatterwithoutlier__](https://github.com/tianyica/scatterwithoutlier/tree/main) package, which creates scatterplot for two quantitative variables with labeled outliers.
