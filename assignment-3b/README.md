## Assignment 3B Note

+ This repo implements Option A from the assignment-3b.

+ This repo add 3 features to the [Basic BC Liquor app](https://github.com/daattali/shiny-server/tree/master/bcl) created by by [Dean Attali](deanattali.com).

+ This [Bcl Shiny App](https://tianyizheng.shinyapps.io/bcl-shiny/) has provided an interactive application that allows users to query, filter and visualize  . 
  Specifically, when comparing with the original version of BCL shiny app, this version has added:
   - Major Features:
     1. Added functional widget to filter by sweetness level: sweetness filter allows users to interact with the two plots and table by choosing the sweetness level they want.
     2. Added functional widget on searching by product name: Although users can search in the data table from the basic version, the plots does not interact with the input, and the new search bar added this functionality, where users can enter words (like "mission hill") and query the available sweetness and alcohol content options.
     3. Added scatter plot on Sweetness v.s . Alcohol Content: This plot allows users to query and visualize the available sweetness and alcohol content levels from the current option.
   - Minor Features: Added the indication phrase on lowest available product price: This allows users to know the cheapest option immediately, without sorting the data table.
   - Minor Edits: Added personal github link and a reference to the assignment repo.

+ The BCL Shiny App is now running at [shinyapps.io](https://tianyizheng.shinyapps.io/bcl-shiny/).

+ The BC Liquor app was originally created by [Dean Attali](deanattali.com), and was copied into the folder "BCL-Shiny" in this repo from Dean's [bcl folder](https://github.com/daattali/shiny-server/tree/master/bcl) in his [shiny-server](https://github.com/daattali/shiny-server) repo.
